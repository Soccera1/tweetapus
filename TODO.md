- automated spam/nsfw detection using openapi or perspective api

- maybe remove gray checkmarks outline

**other things:**

- personalized algorithm + onboarding
- installation cli guide

- use Bun's SQL driver instead of sqlite since it's async

- tweetapus circles like twiter circle

- look into all XSS and similar vulnerabitilies
- optimize client and server
